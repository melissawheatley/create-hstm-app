# Introduction
The `create-hstm-app` is a starting point for HealthStreamers to build react applications.

#### Used in this application

* [React JavaScript framework](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Environment setup from Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
* [HTML/SASS framework from Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Bootstrap + React components from ReactStrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/)
* [Icons from FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* [Prettier for code consistency](https://prettier.io/)
* [Lint rules following Airbnb Javascript Stye Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

# Getting Started

#### Dependencies

* git
* NodeJS >= 10.x
* NPMJS >= 6.x

#### Running locally

1. Clone the repo
1. Navigate to the root folder of the cloned repo
1. Run the command `npm install`
1. Run the command `npm start`

It's suggested that you use a code editor plugin to run `prettier` as you work.

# Build and Test
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the jest test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run clean`

Runs [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) and then the [airbnb based eslint rules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb). Prettier applies the many of the formatting rules that eslint would catch without having to make manual changes.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
